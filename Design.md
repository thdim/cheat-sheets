# Master Digital Product Design: UX Research & UI Design

2. What is Design? 

- The earliest desings in history are about emotions and the experience of the user, not about "usability".
- Almost no new innovation comes because of utility, but because of emotional reasons.
- Human expirience drives innovation, utility comes next.

- Jakob Nielsen "Users spend most of their time on other sites".
- 90% of a design is following the standards. The rest is where you really innovate.
- There are no rules in design, only suggestions and guidelines.
- An app doesn't have any (good or bad) experience. The user using it have an experience, and there are 7 billion of them.

- Values matter, everyone would agree that an iPhone offers a fantastic UX. The reason that not everyone owns it is that some people value money more.
- A mom with 2 kids would probably value safety over a fast car.
- User Experience "The overall experience of a person using a product of a service".
- Everyone in an organization is responsible for the user experience, not only the UX designer.
- Iterative design: follow an established path and the industry standards.
- Innovative design: change the game, be different, ignore rules and standards.
- Create your own process but those are the building steps: 
- Research & Analysis (divergence "quantity")
- Ideate & Test (convergence "quality")
- Every design choise is a compromise. 


6. Critical Thinking

- What is rational is not always correct.
- Without emotions we cannot make decisions.
- Critical thinking is essential for good design, not rationality.
- People act with emotions, then they post-rationalize it.
- Data cannot drive innovative design, only iterative.
- Booking.com had an amazing iterative data-driven team. They didn't see Airbnb coming, it was not in the data.
- Focus groups don't work because people lie, they try to sound rational when in fact are emotional.
- Scandinacian design: 1) build with what you have (not a lot) 2) cooporate with the end user, build it together with them.
